Firstly, I appreciate you taking the time to review my test.

Thanks for the opportunity. I look forward to speaking with you, your company and the journey you're on has peaked my interest.

## Notes

- In my opinion the CSS instructions weren't clear so I have made some guesses. Happy to relay further information regarding this to you.

As always there is room to improve on _any_ engineering feat. I'd love to hear your feedback and get the chance to explain my decision making.
